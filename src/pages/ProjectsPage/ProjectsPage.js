          summary='This is a game where the player must click a block they have not clicked already. The blocks are generated randomly after either a block or the refresh button are clicked. The number of blocks and colors per block can be adjusted in the code to support a much larger variety of blocks. Before the game starts, a node tree is generated, where each node is a color and each branch represents a unique block. The node tree is used to quickly find blocks and determine if blocks have already been clicked. I decided to use a node tree because it was an efficient way to map blocks and it is scalable.'
